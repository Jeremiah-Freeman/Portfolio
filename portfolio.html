        Hello world, so good to finally meet you!  My name is Jeremiah Freeman, a Portland Oregon native who simply can't get enough of life.  I am an aspiring web and app developer with a sincere passion for improving the company I am working with and the world I am living in.  Passion is what drives me, if its not meaningful its not worth doing.

        Professionally, I have always had the entrepreneurial spirit.  For the last better part of the decade I created and maintaned a lucritive and successful Cannabis Farm and participated heavily in building a strong, connected and educated cannabis community by creating the first online Cannabis Social Network in Oregon.  Bootstrapping the project with my childhood school bestfriend and working feaverishy day and night we quickly grew to over 10,000 active users in under 24 months.  It was a passion and a life-style.  Unfortunatly our business skills and coding capabilities were limited and the trolls, Facebook.com and hackers, relentless.  They ended up bringing down the website and destroying the website...but the passions remains.

        Currently I am trianing at Epicodus and working hard to develop my coding skills so as to bring my passion for creating connection and happiness through technology to others.  There has never been a better time to connect with as many people around the globe (and soon Mars) as there is today.  What an amazing time to be alive.  Truly.

          I'd love to hear from you sometime.  Please feel free to drop me an  <a href="mailto:jaythinkshappiness@gmail.com" <strong>email</strong></a>
